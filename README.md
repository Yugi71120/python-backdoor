	<h1>Python Backdoor</h1>
	<p>Python backdoor is a command-line tool that allows an attacker to remotely access and control a compromised machine. It is written in Python and can be used on both Windows and Linux systems.

The backdoor works by opening a reverse connection to the attacker's machine and waiting for commands. The attacker can then use the backdoor to execute commands on the compromised machine, access files, and perform other malicious activities.

This tool is meant for educational purposes only and should not be used for illegal or malicious activities. The developer is not responsible for any damage or harm caused by the misuse of this tool.</p>
	<h2>Features</h2>
	<p>1.Cross-platform support for both Windows and Linux<br>
2.Simple command-line interface for easy use<br>
3.Encrypted communication between the backdoor and the attacker's machine<br>
4.Backdoor can be run as a service to maintain persistence on the compromised machine</p>
